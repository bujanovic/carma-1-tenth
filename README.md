# CARMA 1tenth
![IMG_1187](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49401497/73483195-06a20880-436d-11ea-90c9-7af8032146c0.JPG)
CARMA<sup>SM</sup> program will soon release a scaled down vehicle version that utilizes open source software (OSS) to enable the development of cooperative driving automation features, on the new “CARMA 1tenth” vehicle.  
The goal of the CARMA 1tenth vehicle is as following:
- Enabling the development and testing of CARMA<sup>SM</sup> features on a low-cost, scaled down robotic platform without compromising or limiting the functionality of any aspects of it.
- Engaging a large research community to develop the CARMA<sup>SM</sup> features, by reducing the barriers to entry. 
- Facilitating the testing of scenarios with large vehicle fleets, thus studying large fleet Cooperative Driving Applications (CDA) testing and performance.
- Decreasing the dependence on expensive test tracks and increasing the flexibility of testing time.
- Ensuring the safety of CDA features before testing on actual vehicles. 
This will be an effort toward a practical, low-cost, more efficient, and safer mechanism for developing and testing of CARMA<sup>SM</sup> capabilities before testing on actual roads with actual vehicles.

## What Is CARMA 1tenth
CARMA 1tenth was inspired by the [F1/10](http://f1tenth.org/) program which is a group of more than 20 universities that has regular racing competitions focused on advancing ADS education on scaled down autonomous vehicles.  The concept of CARMA 1tenth sparked from the idea of putting the CARMA Platform<sup>SM</sup> on a smaller scale vehicle to focus on advancing cooperative driving automation with other vehicles and infrastructure using CARMA Cloud<sup>SM</sup>. 
CARMA 1tenth cars will host the same open-source CARMA Platform that is hosted on full scale vehicles. Thus, they will not have to compromise or limit the functionality of any aspect of the platform. This means that once a CDA feature has been validated on 1tenth vehicles, it can be ported over to the full scale vehicles for testing. 
However, the CARMA Platform can operate on both vehicle scales, different drivers may be needed to account for the different types of sensor hardware (e.g. different types of LiDARs, cameras, radars, GPS, communication devices, etc.).
The first prototype CARMA 1tenth car is still in development in the Saxton Lab, McLean VA. The source code will soon be released along with a list of recommended materials. According to the F1/10 website, the estimated cost of building one of these vehicles can range from $3,000 to $4,000 depending on sensor selection.
